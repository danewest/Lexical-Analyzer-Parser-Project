# Lexical-Analyzer-Parser-Project
Project for Programming Languages class written in C

Notes: Documentation is included inside the main C files themselves (parser.c and Lexical Analyzer.c).

Lexical analyzer was completed and has the input files that were made for it and the output files that resulted.
The parser was not completed. Almost the entire parser was implemented but there were a number of problems with getting it to compile and output the proper information. We apologize for not getting it completed yet. We worked on some routes like creating a header file to import/include the necessary functions and global variables from the analyzer file such as lex().

While this is technically not completed it is almost wholly there. We have just struggled to come upon the solution to get it entirely finalized. Hopefully this will work for now.
